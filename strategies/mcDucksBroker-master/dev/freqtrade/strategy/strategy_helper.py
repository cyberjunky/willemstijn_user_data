    Correctly merge informative samples to the original dataframe, avoiding lookahead bias.

    Since dates are candle open dates, merging a 15m candle that starts at 15:00, and a
    1h candle that starts at 15:00 will result in all candles to know the close at 16:00
    which they should not know.

    Moves the date of the informative pair by 1 time interval forward.
    This way, the 14:00 1h candle is merged to 15:00 15m candle, since the 14:00 1h candle is the
    last candle that's closed at 15:00, 15:15, 15:30 or 15:45.
