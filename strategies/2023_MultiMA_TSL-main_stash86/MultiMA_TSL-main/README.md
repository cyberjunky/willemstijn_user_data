# MultiMA_TSL and Cenderawasih (successor of MultiMA)

## Update 2022-7-13
There will be 1 last update on MultiMA, before I retiring the name, and moving forward with Cenderawasih (simpler strat)
Also, the kucoin version has no stoploss. So please do extensive tests before running it live. Big drawdown is expected.

## Important note!!! This strategy is developed and tested using BUSD pairs' data. So it might give better result if it's being used when BUSD is used as the stake, compared to other stake.

Strategy for Freqtrade https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade

This strategy based on SMAOffsetProtectOptV1 (modded by Perkmeister), based on @Lamborghini Store's SMAOffsetProtect strat, heavily based on @tirail's original SMAOffset
