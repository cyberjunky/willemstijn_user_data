# gekko-PSAR-strategy
Hi all, really inspired and impressed with @askmike GEKKO work.
Absolutely new with js, with some light background with py. New here so sorry, I don't know exactly how to mention and provide info about where I found what (#XXX) (any advice welcome)
Trying to set up a basic strategy based on Parabolic SAR indicator found at Illion20 (gekko/strategies/indicators/PSAR.js)
will leave the strat file at the repository as i have it.
Right now GIT.CMD shows three line error, first of them is an instance error which i can't debug by myself. the second and last line gives me no clue. Screen shot at repository too.

Hope anyone interested in gekko and mike's work and interested aswell in deploying PSAR strat would collaborate (if my contribution is worthy in any case) to get this done. So you are welcome

the basic aim of the strat is simple by now just advice long when psar is below price (the objective is to add other functionalities like stoploss and previous candles evaluation to triger the long advice even sooner than  "bull" psar)
